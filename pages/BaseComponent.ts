 * BaseComponent
 *
 * A lightweight base class for Playwright page objects that centralizes common operations
 * performed against a scoped Locator. Intended to be extended by concrete component/page
 * objects to reuse common interaction patterns (clicking, filling, querying text/visibility,
 * and waiting for elements) without repeatedly resolving the same root locator.
 *
 * The instance maintains:
 * - protected page: the Playwright Page instance associated with the provided Locator.
 * - protected element: the root Locator that scopes all interactions performed by this class.
 *
